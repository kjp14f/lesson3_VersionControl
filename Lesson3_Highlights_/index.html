            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that one can recall specific versions later. Each specific version of a file created is assigned a number or a letter called a revision number or level. Each revision is also given a timestamp. Revisions can be compared side-by-side, or even merged! More than one person can work and contribute to a project. Project team members can check files out, make some changes, then check them back, commiting them. Good softwar tools are a must for the organization of a project with many team members. It takes a lot of self-discipline to maintain so many near-identical copies of a program. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control Systems carry out Version Control functions. VCS automatically notes the revision history, when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and can merge changes to the same file. Files cannot be overwritten, or the purpose of VCS would be useless. There are repositories that hold all the files. More than one person can work on the same files at the same time with no trouble. VCS allows one to revert back to an old version of a file of they need to. VCS will back up the files so they won't be lost and a restart of the project is avoided.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system that is free to use and open for everyone. Git can handle everything from the smallest projects to the largest with quickness and virtually no error. Unlike Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase, Git uses cheap local branching, staging areas, multiple workflows to put itself over the top, and become a user favorite. Because Git features multiple local branches, the user can use other helpful tools. One tool is frictionless context switching, where one creates a branch, commits a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you were working, and merge that in. One can use role-based codelines that limits what goes into production, one that merges branches for work for testing, and other smaller branches for day-to-day work. One can use feature based workflow, where you can delete two separate branches after merging them. There is also disposable experimentation. This completely deletes what you are working on, so no one else can see, even after the branches have been pushed.</p>

            <p class="lead">To start off, Git has some basic commands. There's git init, gid add --all, git commit -am 'Initial commit', git log, and git status. For remote commands, there's git remote, git pull, and git push. Git clone_ clones a remote repository in _ to a local folder if need be. Git log shows all of the backups created in the repository. Git status shows files that were changed since the previous backup was made an which ones are already added to the staging area. Git blame_ shows who wrote which line of code or who is to be blamed for that particular line of messed up code. Git diff shows the difference of the working directory and the backups in the repository. One starts out with a working directory. One uses the command git init to initialize the repository. Next, use git remote add origin_ to add a remote place called 'Origin who has a url _. Access a repository and click git add . This adds all of the files that were changed since the last backup to the staging area. Then type git commit -m "..." to commit the changes made to the repository. Then, git push pushes those changes in the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. Git pull can pull those changes from the remote repository back to the local repository. From there it's a circle. You can go round and round repeating these steps. </p>

            <p class="lead">A repository is a location where data is stored and managed. There are two types of repositories. There is a remote repository. The remote repository is on a remote server that is shared among more than one person. There is also a local repository. The local repository is on a local computer controlled personally by an individual. There are two ways to create a local repository. One way is to simply create one, the other is to clone an existing remote repository onto a local computer. When a repository is created with directories and files, developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and versions. </p>
